### Purpose

A simple exercise to build a trello clone. The specs came from an interview session. I don't remember all of it in detail, tried my best to approximate.

Try and see if you can create this from scratch in 1 hour! I couldn't, but appreciated the challenge nonetheless.

#### Requirements
- There are 4 fixed columns to which cards may be added
- Each column has a header that has a unique colour (title and colour are fixed)
- Each column will start with 2 cards
- Columns can resize and are always equal width but does not need to be _mobile_-responsive
- Cards can be added to columns using the `window.prompt` API (they do not need to be deletable)
- Cards can be moved from a column to its adjacent column using arrow-buttons (no drag and drop)
- ...possibly more but I forgot ðŸ™‚
